# Control System Simulation in MATLAB

A comprehensive collection of MATLAB scripts, functions, and documentation for simulating and designing control systems.

## About

This repository is dedicated to various aspects of control system simulation and analysis using MATLAB. It covers essential topics such as transfer function modeling, PID controller design and tuning, system response analysis, and response correction techniques. The examples and codes are intended for both academic learning and practical engineering applications.

## Topics Covered

- **Transfer Function Modeling**
  - Defining and analyzing transfer functions
  - Open-loop and closed-loop system representations
- **PID Controller Design**
  - Implementation and tuning of Proportional-Integral-Derivative controllers
  - Simulation of controller effects on system performance
- **System Response Analysis**
  - Step response, impulse response, frequency response (Bode, Nyquist plots)
  - Time-domain and frequency-domain analysis
- **Response Correction Techniques**
  - Lead/lag compensators
  - Disturbance rejection
  - Setpoint tracking improvements
- **Practical Control System Examples**
  - Real-world system modeling and simulation
  - Controller design for mechanical, electrical, and thermal systems
